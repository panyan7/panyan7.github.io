In this blog, I document my thoughts after viewing some certain photography artists and works in 2025.

# (Re)Constructing History at SF MOMA

## [*Green Book*](https://www.jonathancalm.com/test/) by Jonathan Calm

“Green Book” refers to the “The Negro Motorist Green Book,” a guidebook for black roadtrippers from 1936-1966 when descrimination against black people was widespread. The 2018 film [*Green Book*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Book_(film)) is also named after this guidebook. Most photos in this project were taken in 2019, so I guess the artist probably came up with this idea after watching the 2018 film. The artist wants to document the sites in the book and witness their transformation after many decades.

The photos are shot in black and white, which makes the audiences feel that this photo is taken decades ago back to the 60s at the first sight. However, when they look more carefully, there are various evidences that show the photos are actually contemporary. The first of such evidence to me is that the tones appear to be very digital, very different from old films. The project also includes several panorama photos, which is a digital photography technique and was impossible at the film photography era. I can also notice some modern cars and people’s modern outfit in some of the photos. This mixture of modern and old elements creates a strange but interesting feeling to me.

## [*Rephotographic Survey Project*](https://www.markklett.com/projects/rephotographic-survey-project) by Various Artists

The project was taken from 1977 to 1979 by a few artists. The artists took new photographs of certain sites that try to duplicate or mimic some original historical images of the American West.

This is a very common idea for content creators on social media right now. For example, many people tried to duplicate Ansel Adams’ works. This is probably the earliest project of this form.

Some of the works are more interesting than just replicating. For example, this middle photo by Rick Dingus is very similar to some “photograph reframing” posts on social media (I’ve seen a lot of those on Douban).

For this pair of images, it actually took me some time to realize that they are taken at the same place.
