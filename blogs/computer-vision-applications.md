# Computer Vision in Practice

Computer vision has transformed how machines interpret and understand visual information. Let's explore its real-world applications.

## Image Classification

Teaching machines to recognize and categorize objects in images has applications in medical diagnosis, quality control, and content moderation.

## Object Detection

Beyond classification, object detection locates and identifies multiple objects within images, powering autonomous vehicles and surveillance systems.

## Image Segmentation

Pixel-level understanding enables precise analysis for applications like medical imaging and augmented reality.
