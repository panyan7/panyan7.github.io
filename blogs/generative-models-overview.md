# Generative Models: An Overview

Generative models have emerged as one of the most exciting areas in machine learning, capable of creating new data that resembles training data. Let's explore the different types and their applications.

## Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

GANs consist of two neural networks competing against each other: a generator that creates fake data and a discriminator that tries to distinguish between real and fake data.

## Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

VAEs learn to encode data into a lower-dimensional latent space and then decode it back to the original space, enabling generation of new samples.

## Diffusion Models

Diffusion models work by gradually adding noise to data and then learning to reverse this process, resulting in high-quality generated samples.

## Applications

Generative models find applications in image synthesis, text generation, drug discovery, and many other domains where creating new data is valuable.
