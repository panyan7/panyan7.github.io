# Deep Learning Fundamentals

Deep learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence, enabling machines to learn complex patterns from data. In this post, I'll explore the fundamental concepts that form the foundation of deep learning.

## Neural Networks

At the heart of deep learning are artificial neural networks, computational models inspired by biological neural networks. These networks consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers.

## Backpropagation

Backpropagation is the algorithm that allows neural networks to learn from their mistakes. It works by calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight in the network, then adjusting the weights to minimize the loss.

## Activation Functions

Activation functions introduce non-linearity into neural networks, enabling them to learn complex patterns. Common activation functions include ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh.

## Optimization Techniques

Various optimization algorithms help neural networks converge to better solutions. Gradient descent, Adam, and RMSprop are among the most commonly used optimizers.
