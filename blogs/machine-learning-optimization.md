# Optimization in Machine Learning

Optimization lies at the heart of machine learning, determining how models learn from data. Understanding optimization algorithms is crucial for building effective ML systems.

## Gradient Descent

The foundation of most optimization algorithms, gradient descent iteratively adjusts parameters to minimize the loss function.

## Momentum

Momentum helps optimization algorithms overcome local minima and converge faster by maintaining a moving average of gradients.

## Adam Optimizer

Adam combines the benefits of momentum and adaptive learning rates, making it one of the most popular optimizers in modern ML.
