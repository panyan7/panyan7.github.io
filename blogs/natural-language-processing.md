# Natural Language Processing Trends

Natural Language Processing has seen remarkable advances in recent years, driven by transformer architectures and large language models.

## Transformer Architecture

The transformer architecture revolutionized NLP by introducing attention mechanisms that allow models to focus on relevant parts of input sequences.

## Large Language Models

Models like GPT and BERT demonstrate the power of scale, showing emergent capabilities as model size increases.

## Future Directions

Multimodal models, efficient architectures, and alignment research are shaping the future of NLP applications.
